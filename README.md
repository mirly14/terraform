# Terraform Snowflake Provider Plugin

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive guide on using the Terraform provider plugin for managing Snowflake objects. It includes instructions for setting up providers and managing a variety of Snowflake resources, including accounts, users, roles, databases, warehouses, schemas, stages, shares, and snowpipes.

## What is [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/?_fsi=tyzFVo60&_fsi=tyzFVo60)?
Terraform is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp that enables Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It allows you to define and automate the setup of computer infrastructure using code, similar to writing software. Terraform employs a declarative syntax akin to YAML, letting you specify the desired state of your infrastructure.

## How to install Terraform
Follow the steps [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?_fsi=wJn8vvGZ&_fsi=wJn8vvGZ)

## Useful commands
```
terraform init # to start your terraform project
terraform plan # to check all the objects you are going to create
terraform apply # to construct on Snowflake all the objects you set up  
terraform destroy # to remove every object/privilege you created on Snowflake
``` 

## Key Features
Declarative Syntax: Unlike imperative programming languages like SQL, JavaScript, or Python, Terraform uses a declarative approach, simplifying the definition of infrastructure.

State Management: Terraform tracks the current state of your infrastructure and compares it with the desired state, generating a plan for creating, updating, or deleting resources.

Dependency Management: The generated plan is represented as an acyclic graph, enabling Terraform to understand and manage dependencies between resources.

Snowflake Integration: Terraform is particularly effective for managing Snowflake account-level resources such as Warehouses, Databases, Schemas, Tables, and Roles/Grants.

**By using Terraform, you can script the setup of different objects instead of doing it manually, making it easier to handle complex environments efficiently and consistently.**
